# README

This is code for the paper Green, David K. E. and Rindler, Filip (2020) *Probabilistic solution of chaotic dynamical system inverse problems using Bayesian Artificial Neural Networks*.

See: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13028

# Code layout

The code is in two main folders:
- `BayesTF`: A package containing code for simulating ODEs and learning inverse models.
- `paperCode`: The code used to produce the figures in the paper. Also contains the data used to produce the figures in the paper. See the README.md file in this folder for instructions on generating the data in the paper.
